## Introduction
Personal Audio Component for the Apple Tree

By integrating natural audio elements, the personal audio component of the "Apple tree" artwork seeks to represent the natural forces portrayed in the artwork, such as the rustling of leaves and the sound of the wind. Users can input audio, including human voices or phone audio and more, to control the speed at which apples grow on the tree based on the frequency of the input. This interactive experience culminates in a "surprise ending," where participants engage by gently blowing to release apples, each accompanied by a whimsical caption. For instance, captions may read, "You might have just received a Jobs' apple" or "This might be Newton's apple," adding an element of amusement.

The personal audio component places a strong emphasis on user interaction with the artwork through sound, underscoring the participants' involvement in the entire art experience.
